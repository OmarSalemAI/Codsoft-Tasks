Tasks of Internship Data Science In Codsoft
Codsoft Data Science Internship Projects
Welcome to the repository showcasing my Data Science internship projects at Codsoft! In this internship, I tackled three exciting tasks, each highlighting different aspects of data analysis and machine learning.

1. Titanic Survivor Analysis with Logistic Regression
Objective:
Predict the survival outcomes of passengers aboard the Titanic using logistic regression.

Key Highlights:

Explored and analyzed the Titanic dataset to understand key features influencing survival.
Implemented logistic regression for binary classification to predict survival probabilities.
Conducted thorough model evaluation and interpretation of results.
